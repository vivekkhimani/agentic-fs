## The vision in one line

Give AI agents **filesystem-style access to an org's documents** — `list` /
`glob` / `grep` / ranged `read` / semantic `search` — over documents in **their
own S3**, exposed through **MCP + REST**, multi-tenant, deployable with **one
`terraform apply`**, **~$2/mo idle**, with **every stateful layer swappable**.

We are building it **infrastructure-first**: the deployment guardrails and the
canonical storage substrate before the application code, so every later slice
lands into a pipeline and a data model already proven safe.

## Where we are right now (live in AWS `002988089284`)

| Resource | Role in the vision |
|---|---|
| `agentic-fs-terraform-state-…` (S3) | Remote state — the "one `terraform apply`" promise rests on this |
| `agentic-fs-terraform-{plan,apply}` (IAM) + `agentic-fs-ci-boundary` | Safe, least-privilege CI delivery — guardrails before payload |
| `alias/agentic-fs-data` → CMK | **SSE-KMS everywhere** — the encryption floor of the security model |
| `agentic-fs-data-…` (S3) | **S3 is canonical** — the single source of truth the whole system heals from |
| `agentic-fs-catalog` (DynamoDB) | The **derived index** of S3 — fast `list`/`glob`/`stat`; healable; first-class `catalog_only` |
| `agentic-fs-api` (Lambda container) + streaming Function URL | **Serving compute is live** — the MCP+REST surface, rolled by image CD; exec role now carries the ingestion write path |

Tag-discoverable resources (`Project=agentic-fs`), so the entire footprint
is teardown-by-one-query — a design goal from day one, not an afterthought.
(IAM roles are tagged too but the Resource Groups Tagging API can't enumerate
IAM.)

**The full read *and* write loop is live on AWS:** a SigV4 caller `PUT`s a
document to the Function URL → it lands in S3 (SSE-KMS), is extracted
(`text_native`), and a catalog row appears → `fs/stat`/`read` return it →
`delete` removes it. Same loop is proven locally on MinIO + DynamoDB Local.

### Application track (deployed — API + ingestion live on AWS)

| Package | What's in it |
|---|---|
| `afs-core` | the **contracts** (`ObjectStore` · `CatalogStore` · `Normalizer` · `Connector` Protocols), DTOs, the key scheme, the closed error vocabulary, and the **conformance kits** for each |
| `afs-server` | `settings`, the **pluggable store registry**, `S3ObjectStore` + `DynamoDBCatalogStore` (moto-certified), the **`FsService` read path**, the **`IngestService` + `ExtractionPipeline` write path** (lightweight `text_native`/`pdf`/`docx` rungs in-request; OCR/heavy rungs as opt-in extras — `textract` (AWS OCR), `docling` — escalate, [ADR 0006](decisions/0006-extraction-normalizer-contract.md)), a **FastAPI app** (`/v1/healthz` · `/readyz` · `/me` · `fs/{ns}/{entries,stat,doc}` · `ingest/{ns}/doc` PUT+DELETE), and an **MCP mount** at `/mcp` (`whoami` · `fs_list` · `fs_stat` · `fs_read`, in-process) |
| `afs-connector-sdk` | the **`fs-crawler` CLI** + `SyncEngine` (discover → **version-skip / checksum-skip** → ingest → prune, with **incremental delta + server-side checkpoints**, [ADR 0008](decisions/0008-incremental-sync.md)) + `IngestClient` (SigV4 / no-auth) + **Local FS**, **S3**, and **Google Drive** (OAuth + native-doc export) connectors ([ADR 0007](decisions/0007-connector-model.md)) — verified end-to-end against the live Function URL |

The API is **containerized** ([`Dockerfile`](../Dockerfile), [ADR 0003](decisions/0003-container-image.md)):
one multi-stage, non-root, ~190 MB image runs uvicorn on **Lambda (Web Adapter) +
Fargate + locally** — live on the Function URL, rolled on merge by image CD
([ADR 0004](decisions/0004-image-cd.md)). `make dev` runs it against MinIO +
DynamoDB Local.

**Both stores done.** Swap-ability is real and demonstrated:
- object store — the S3 store *is* the store for any S3-compatible endpoint
  (MinIO, Cloudflare R2, Wasabi, B2) via one env var
  ([swap guide](swap-guides/object-store.md)).
- catalog store — `DynamoDBCatalogStore` over the single-table schema; another
  backend (e.g. Postgres) is implement → certify → register
  ([swap guide](swap-guides/catalog.md)).

Both proven by the *same* conformance kit that certifies the in-memory fakes
([ADR 0002](decisions/0002-pluggable-backends-via-entry-points.md)).

## How the infrastructure maps to the architecture

The component diagram (`agentic-fs-oss-plan.md` §2.2) decomposes into modules.
Status against each:

| Architecture component | Module(s) | Status | Why it exists (vision tie-in) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Deploy/CI/state/identity | `global/bootstrap`, `global/ci-roles`, `.github/workflows` | ✅ done | "Deploys into your AWS account" — and lets us iterate without blast radius |
| Data bucket (`tenants/`+`derived/`+`scratch/`) | `storage` | ✅ done | **S3 is canonical; everything else is derived and healable from it** (the load-bearing principle) |
| Encryption / tenancy floor | `kms` | ✅ done | **Multi-tenant, enterprise-secure by default** — SSE-KMS on every object |
| Catalog (list/glob/stat index) | `catalog_dynamodb` (default) / `catalog_postgres` | ✅ done | The **derived index** of S3 — navigation without O(corpus) S3 LISTs; healable; **swappable** |
| Serving compute (MCP+REST) | `compute_lambda` (default) / `compute_fargate` | ✅ done (live) | **MCP-first, agent-shaped** — streaming Function URL (AWS_IAM); OAuth resource server + enforcement boundary still to come |
| Ingest → extract → heal | `ingestion` ✅ | **Hybrid extraction** (ADR 0009): serving extracts common files **inline** (light `text_native,pdf,docx` ladder, instant) while the **S3-event worker** OCR-escalates the rest — EventBridge → SQS (+DLQ) → worker Lambda. The worker image is **parametric** (`Dockerfile.worker`, `AFS_EXTRAS` build arg): the slim default runs `text_native,pdf,docx,textract` (~700 MB, managed OCR, no torch); `docling` is an opt-in heavy build. A rung named without its extra declines safely. Skips rows already extracted inline. **Structured logging** (structlog → JSON in CloudWatch, console in dev; `AFS_LOG_LEVEL`) surfaces declines/escalation/per-doc progress; the **DLQ** is locked to the extract queue with a redrive-allow policy (move-back after a fix). The scheduled **reconciler** ([ADR 0011](decisions/0011-reconciliation.md), EventBridge rate → Lambda) heals catalog↔S3 drift: missing/stale/re-added objects are enqueued for the worker, orphaned rows are **soft-deleted** (tombstones revive if the file returns) ✅. CloudWatch **alarms** are the remaining piece |
| Connectors (source → ingest) | `afs-connector-sdk` | 🔧 local + S3 + Drive | **Point it at your documents** — client-side crawlers push to the ingest API, with **incremental sync** (version-skip + delta cursors, [ADR 0008](decisions/0008-incremental-sync.md)) so big sources aren't re-crawled wholesale. Local FS / S3 / **Google Drive** (OAuth + export) ship; Drive's delta `changes.list` + SharePoint are next |
| Semantic search (optional) | `search_bedrock_kb` | M3+ | **Grep is the floor; search is an accelerator you switch on** |
| OAuth IdP (optional) | `auth_cognito` | M1/opt | OAuth 2.1 resource server, batteries-included, $0 under free tier |
| Malware gate, audit, alarms | `security_guardduty`, `observability` | opt | Enterprise hardening — none of it bolted on later |

## Milestone roadmap

Each milestone is a **vertical slice** — infrastructure + the app code that uses
it — so the system is demoable at every step (plan §15).

- **Phase 0 — Guardrails** ✅ — state backend, OIDC plan/apply roles + permissions
  boundary, CI (validate → plan → gated sandbox apply → weekly drift), tflint +
  trivy gates, tagging, module/example scaffolds.
- **M0 — Foundation** ✅ — `kms` + `storage`. S3-is-canonical is now real.
- **M1 — Read path** ✅ — `catalog_dynamodb` + `compute_lambda` + dev auth, live
  on the Function URL: an agent can `list`/`read` a corpus over MCP/REST.
- **M2 — Ingestion & extraction** 🔧 in progress — **write path live**
  (in-request `PUT`→extract→`derived/` + catalog row, verified on AWS); the
  **`docling` rung** (PDF/Office/images), the **connector SDK** (`fs-crawler`,
  Local FS + S3 + **Google Drive** with OAuth + native-doc export), and
  **incremental sync** (version-skip + delta cursors + server-side checkpoints,
  [ADR 0008](decisions/0008-incremental-sync.md)), and the **async extraction
  worker** + two-mode ingest + the **`ingestion` Terraform module** (EventBridge →
  SQS → `docling` worker Lambda, [ADR 0009](decisions/0009-async-extraction-pipeline.md))
  have landed (async path **live-validated**: a scanned PDF degrades to
  `catalog_only` inline and the worker escalates it via Textract OCR). The
  scheduled **reconciler** now heals catalog↔S3 drift (soft-delete orphans;
  re-added files revive) ✅. The **extraction-routing** upgrade — a Haystack pipeline
  engine with structure-preserving + multimodal rungs (`textract_analyze` ✅, `llm` ✅),
  cascade/content-type/optional-LLM routing ([ADR 0010](decisions/0010-extraction-routing-and-pipeline-engine.md)).
  The quality gate now escalates on **confidence** (`AFS_MIN_CONFIDENCE`) as well as
  char count ✅ — shaky OCR can fall through to a stronger rung. The **Haystack
  engine** is wired (phase 1) — `AFS_PIPELINE_ENGINE=haystack` runs the cascade as a
  Haystack `AsyncPipeline` (rungs as components), behavior-equivalent to the ladder
  ✅. It's now the **default engine** (with the `[haystack]` extra, shipped in the
  worker image); the ladder stays a slim, zero-dep **"lite" mode**
  (`AFS_PIPELINE_ENGINE=ladder`, also the transparent fallback when the extra is
  absent) ✅. **Presets** (`AFS_PIPELINE_PRESET=lite|ocr|tables|multimodal|full`)
  let users pick a curated pipeline instead of hand-listing rungs ✅.
  **Content-type routing** (`AFS_PIPELINE_FILE` → per-MIME ladders in YAML) sends
  images to vision, PDFs to table-structure rungs, etc. ✅ — this is what the
  Haystack engine unlocks over the linear ladder. Then Drive's delta
  `changes.list` (L2) + SharePoint. *Exit (met):* a corrupt PDF lands
  `catalog_only` and is still cite-able; a hand-deleted catalog row heals on the
  next reconciler sweep.
  - **Backlog (post-engine):** ship a set of **pre-packaged Haystack pipeline
    presets** users pick from instead of wiring components themselves — e.g.
    `cheap-text` (lightweight only), `scanned-docs` (OCR escalation),
    `tables-and-forms` (textract_analyze), `max-fidelity` (llm/multimodal),
    `maritime` (drawings + tables + scans). Each a named, YAML-serialized pipeline.
- **M3 — Grep, scratch, budgets** — two-stage budgeted grep, scratch namespace,
  full MCP middleware (visibility, per-call enforcement, audit). *Exit:* an agent
  greps a 1k-file corpus under budget.
- **M4+ — Accelerators & hardening** — `search_bedrock_kb`, `auth_cognito`,
  `compute_fargate`/`network`, `observability`, `security_guardduty`; the
  `hardened`/`full`/`byo-postgres` example roots.

## How the pipeline keeps us safe as we add each piece

The Phase-0 work isn't scaffolding we move past — it's the rail every slice rides:

1. Branch off `master` → PR. CI runs `validate` (fmt/validate/tflint/trivy,
   credential-free + fork-safe) and a **read-only plan** that comments the exact
   diff.
2. Merge → the `apply` job assumes the **boundary-capped** apply role from the
   gated `sandbox` environment and applies only the quickstart root.
3. Weekly **drift** plan opens an issue if live AWS diverges from state.

Because the apply role is **PowerUser + permissions boundary** (not per-action
enumeration — see `terraform/DECISIONS.md` §2a), most milestones need **no
ci-roles change**. The one rule to remember: any module that creates an IAM role
(first: `compute_lambda` in M1) must set `permissions_boundary` to the
`permissions_boundary_arn` output, or the boundary denies its creation.

## The runway to "image + AWS"

We build and test **locally first**; the container image + AWS deploy is the last
step of the read path, when the app actually serves requests — no premature shell.

```
✅ afs-core foundations (keys/errors/models)
✅ afs-core contracts + conformance kits
✅ afs-server: settings + store registry + S3 ObjectStore (moto-certified)
✅ afs-server: DynamoDB CatalogStore (certified by the same kit)
✅ afs-server: FsService read path + FastAPI app + Dockerfile + docker-compose
✅ afs-server: MCP mount at /mcp (whoami/fs_list/fs_stat/fs_read, shared FsService)
✅ ecr_mirror + compute_lambda + image CD (image.yml: build/push/roll on merge)
✅ DEPLOYED — API LIVE on Lambda + Function URL (AWS_IAM); healthz/readyz/me/entries
      verified via SigV4. readyz=ok ⇒ the Lambda reached DynamoDB through its
      least-priv, boundary-bound exec role. The whole AWS path works end-to-end.
⏭️ ingestion + extraction → documents actually land and become readable          ← next
      (the live API answers, but the corpus is empty until ingestion)
```

When `compute_lambda` lands it is the **first IAM-role-creating module**, so it
takes a `permissions_boundary_arn` and sets it on the Lambda exec role, threaded
from the `ci-roles` output (the boundary's escalation-prevention deny enforces it
— `terraform/DECISIONS.md` §2a).

## Remaining docket (roadmap)

**Product — toward a demoable v1:**

- **Ingestion & extraction (M2)** — write path ✅ (`put_document` → S3 + catalog
  row); extraction is a **pluggable `Normalizer` contract** ✅ (`ExtractionPipeline`
  ladder; `text_native` rung shipped, `docling`/your-own register via
  `afs.normalizers` — [ADR 0006](decisions/0006-extraction-normalizer-contract.md),
  [swap guide](swap-guides/extraction.md)). *Next on this track:* the event-driven
  extractor worker (S3→SQS→pipeline), the connector SDK + `fs-crawler`, the
  presigned-upload flow, and the reconciler.
- **Grep, scratch, budgets (M3)** — two-stage grep, glob, the scratch namespace,
  and the full MCP middleware (per-call enforcement, budgets, audit log).
- **OAuth 2.1 resource server** (+ `auth_cognito`) — replaces dev-auth; required
  for real multi-tenant and to safely set the Function URL to `NONE`/public.

**Platform / enablers:**

- **OpenAPI export + `x-mcp-tool` extensions** + codegen drift-gate → unblocks
  typed clients, the edge Worker, and the Speakeasy evaluation.
- `search_bedrock_kb` (optional semantic), `observability` (alarms/dashboard),
  `catalog_postgres` (proves the catalog swap for real), `compute_fargate` +
  `network`, and the `hardened`/`full` example roots.

**Release / consumption plumbing** (prerequisites for the dogfood consumer repo):

- **Package release** — `release.yml`: `uv build` the three packages → PyPI, with
  versioned tags.
- **Image publishing** — publish `agentic-fs-api` to a public registry (GHCR /
  public ECR) so consumers can mirror it into their own account.
- **Externally-consumable Terraform modules** — see the distribution note below.

## Deferred / to investigate

Tracked here so they aren't lost — intentionally *not* built yet.

- **`compute_fargate` + `network` (alternate compute)** — the same image behind
  an ALB on ECS for always-on / no-cold-start / OCR-at-scale. Deferred to the
  **"release configs" milestone** (alongside the `hardened`/`full` example roots):
  it pulls in a VPC + ALB + ECS service (~$36+/mo while up, real teardown), and
  the default Lambda path already proves the image runs. Implement it as a
  deliberate config option for the OSS release, not a throwaway test now.
- **MCP edge Worker (Cloudflare)** — optional edge layer that terminates MCP +
  OAuth and calls the REST data plane (plan §7.1; `docs/swap-guides/compute.md`).
  **Deferred on purpose:** its client + tools table are *generated* from
  `schemas/openapi.json` + the `x-mcp-tool` route extensions, and the primary MCP
  surface is the in-process Python mount — none of which exist yet. Building it
  earlier means hand-stubbed, throwaway code plus a premature Node/wrangler
  toolchain. Sequence: Python MCP mount → OpenAPI export + `x-mcp-tool` → *then*
  scaffold `workers/mcp-edge/` (generate, don't hand-write) and deploy via
  Wrangler.

- **Codegen for the MCP/SDK surface — evaluate [Speakeasy](https://www.speakeasy.com/).**
  The plan hand-rolls the generation pipeline (`openapi-typescript` for the client
  + a custom emitter for the tools table from `x-mcp-tool` / `x-required-scopes`,
  plan §7.1, §12). Speakeasy generates **SDKs and an MCP server directly from an
  OpenAPI spec**, which overlaps heavily with what we'd otherwise build by hand.
  **Evaluate once the OpenAPI export lands** — if it covers the MCP-tool +
  scopes mapping, it could replace the custom `gen:client` / `gen:tools` step (and
  may subsume the edge-Worker codegen too). Decide via an ADR at that point.

- **Dogfood via a separate consumer repo (BYO-AWS validation).** The whole pitch
  is "deploy into *your* account: `pip install` + `terraform apply`." A second
  repo that consumes our published packages + tagged Terraform modules + mirrored
  image — deploying agentic-fs into its own account and ingesting/reading docs —
  is the real proof. **Sequencing:** keep building the product here (fast
  monorepo iteration); do the release plumbing in parallel; stand up a *thin*
  deploy-only dogfood as soon as packages/image/modules publish; do the *full*
  dogfood after ingestion; **then tear down this maintainer sandbox via the
  `Project=agentic-fs` tag** (which also validates the teardown story). Two
  consumption surfaces with different friction: the **Python packages** (easy once
  published) and the **Terraform modules**, which need (1) tagged module refs,
  (2) decoupling from monorepo specifics (`compute_lambda` currently reads *our*
  `ci-roles` boundary from remote state, and the boundary is *required* — must
  become **optional** for external roots, plus a monorepo-free `quickstart`
  variant), and (3) **image distribution**: Lambda pulls only from same-account
  ECR, so the consumer flow is *publish image publicly → their `ecr_mirror` copies
  it into their ECR → their `compute_lambda` points at the copy* (the "mirror"
  half of `ecr_mirror`, currently deferred, becomes a prerequisite).

- **Distribution & repo visibility (no rush — sequence with the consumer repo).**
  - Publishing to **PyPI works from a private repo** (OIDC trusted publishing; the
    source stays private). *But a pypi.org package is public* — anyone can install
    and read the wheel. Truly-private packages would need a private index (AWS
    CodeArtifact), not pypi.org.
  - **We don't need the repo public for PyPI**, but we *do* for frictionless
    Terraform `git::` module sources (a private repo forces consumers' CI to carry
    a deploy key/PAT). Public = anonymous.
  - **Pre-public cleanup (decision: do it as the "make it consumable" slice, not
    now):** parameterize the hardcoded account ID `002988089284` (it's baked into
    ci-roles/bootstrap defaults, the backend blocks, `quickstart`, the README, and
    the `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` secret) into variables/placeholders; decouple the
    monorepo-specific CI. Account IDs aren't *secret*, but hardcoding the
    maintainer's sandbox throughout an OSS template is poor hygiene.
  - **Recommendation:** keep developing privately; do the parameterization +
    visibility flip as a deliberate slice when wiring the consumer repo. Until
    then, **avoid adding new account-ID / monorepo coupling.** Promote this to a
    proper ADR (`docs/decisions/`) when we commit to the public timeline.
